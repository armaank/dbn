Good evening, and thank\nyou all for being here.
It's really great pleasure to be\nable to welcome Professor Erik
Swyngedouw.
I think a lot of\npeople in the school
are very familiar with\nProfessor Swyngedouw's writings.
In the context of\na design school,
we're always seeking\npeople who are
writing about questions\nof urbanization,
issues of globalization.
And their writings\ncan be, really,
both important in\nterms of understanding
of those situations,\nbut also inspiring to us
in terms of values, the\nkind of things that matter.
And I think it's really hard\nto think of too many people who
are really covering\nthe types of issues
that Erik has been dealing with\nover the last 20 years or so
in his writing that really\ntouches on questions
of the environment, dealing\nwith aspects of ecology, water,
many of the things that cross\nfrom architecture to landscape
to urbanization.
And it's really great\nthat we're finally
able to have him here\nand lecture to us.
It's also-- it takes a\ncertain European perspective,
I suppose, of context of\nbeing raised in Belgium,
and spending time in Holland\nand France and the UK,
to go through a sort of\neducation that starts with, I
suppose, partly agricultural\nengineering from the beginning,
then going to urban\nplanning, and then really
going to geography, and\nthe political issues.
And I think the\ncombination of those
produces a very interesting\nset of conditions, where
I think, I'm just\nassuming, that having
had the interest in\nagricultural engineering,
there's something very\nspecific linked to the land,
and to the way things are\nmade, and so on and so forth.
And then finally\nending up doing a PhD
with David Harvey at\nJohns Hopkins on probably
a much more theoretical, but\nnevertheless the value system,
I think, are still\ndeeply rooted to the kind
of local situations, and\nunderstanding of those themes.
And of course, Erik\nhas gone on to,
both by himself but also a\nlot of times in collaboration
with others, produce an\namazing array of articles,
over hundreds of them\nand of course many books.
I also feel, just to do a\nlittle bit of a plug for us,
I feel very lucky that\nErik was able to contribute
to this book,\nEthics of the Urban,
the City and the Spaces\nof the Political,
that's just coming\nout now, where
he wrote a wonderful essay.
So, we're really happy\nthat you are here.
Please join me in welcoming\nProfessor Erik Swyngedouw.
[APPLAUSE]
Thank you very much for\nthis wonderful introduction.
It's a pleasure to be\nhere, not only because it
is, of course, a privilege\nto be standing here
and to address an\naudience like this,
but also because I like talking\nto designers, architects,
and planners.
I am not.
I was trained as a\nplanner a long time ago,
but I'm now institutionalized\nas a geographer, which
is this is kind of worldly thing\nthat no one really knows what
precisely it is, but which\noffers me the kind of space
to intellectually do\nwhatever I really want to do.
And that's exactly\nwhy I like talking
to designers and architects,\nbecause in contrast to me--
I can just think.
My thoughts can just wildly\ngo wherever my thoughts want
to take me, but\nyou, guys and girls,
you have to do something.
You ultimately have\nto turn thought
into concrete and steel.
And I don't know\nexactly, myself,
how I would do that if I\nwere in your sort of place,
but I think that what you're\ndoing is extremely important.
So, the articulation between\nthought and practice, I think,
is what spaces like this\nought to be all about.
What I want to talk to you\nabout today is the City of Gods.
But a city as a political\nspace, the city as polis,
not the city as just an\nagglomeration of bodies
and stuff together, but the city\n[? called polis, ?] the city
as the space, the\nplace, the environment,
where [? the ?] [? democratic ?]\nis always contested,
fought over, struggled\nover, and occasionally,
not that fairly often, put\ninto some sort of practice.
And I think that is a\nchallenge for us today,
and is this challenge\nthat I really
want to talk about,\nbecause I think
we live in very strange times.
And what I want to concentrate\non for the next 50 minutes
or so is a strange\nparadox, and the paradox
sounds more as follows.
He said, on the one hand,\na number of interlocutors,
intellectuals, academics,\njournalists, and others,
have been arguing for\nmore than 20 years
now, that we are living\nin depoliticizing times,
that there is a general\naversion, oft disdain,
for the political,\nthat things have
been reduced to the\ntechno-managerial management
of the situation.
There is no real alternative\npossible than living
in the globalized neoliberal\ncity that we live in.
The only thing we\ncan do is manage it
to the best of our\ntechno-managerial abilities.
But the real political\nchoice is suspended.
That's one side of the argument.
And I would argue, for\nexample, that to complete this
that Trump in the US, or Le Pen\nin France, are, in many ways,
a symptom of displays\nof depoliticization.
On the other hand--
and particularly since what\nI and others have called
"the magical year\n2011," and why it\'s
magical I'll explain\nin a moment--
since the magical year\n2011, a growing number
of people worldwide, in cities\nin many parts of the world,
have begun to say, "No.
This has to stop.
We are indeed living in\npost-democratic times,
but we want to re-conquer\nthe democratic."
And also, the emanation\nof these desires
for the conquest of the\ndemocratic unfolded and then
the [? urban. ?]
So, that's a strange paradox.
On the one hand, we've\nalready seen so many people
fighting for something\nelse, for democratization.
And on the other\nhand, those argue
there is no real\nchoice possible.
It's that paradox that\nI want to explore.
And I think I can't be in any\nbetter company than Michel
Foucault, who, in one of his\nlast seminars before he died,
was, of course, addressing the\nquestion of the political a bit
more widely than his earlier\nwork that all of us know,
and cite profusely, where\nhe talks about a couple
of constructions\nand [? solutions ?]
of everyday power,\nto in his later work,
considered the biggest\nsort of questions
of geopolitical power.
And in one of those\nseminars, he said,
quite controversially,\nand very rarely
picked up by scholars of\nhis work, is, "The people--"
and he means, of course, the\npeople as a political category,
not the population as a\nsociological category--
"The people is\nthose who, refusing
to be the population\nthat is the objects
of biopolitical governance,\ndisrupt the system."
I think that sets the tone\nwell for what I want to say.
So, the title of my talk\nis, Insurgent Architects
and the Spectral\nReturn of the Political
in the Post-Democratic City.
For people who want\nto know more about it,
this one I'll talk\nabout is part of some
of what is being discussed\nat length in these two books.
I have a few chapters\nin the light hand one,
Can Architecture Be an\nEmancipatory Project?
Interesting question, isn't it?
As is often the case,\nit is not academics
who offer us the\nmost incisive insight
in the situation of our times.
As we all know, it's often\nnovelists, poets, movie makers,
who in many, many\nways tell us exactly,
do with surgical\nprecision the analysis
of the condition\nthat we live in.
We academics are\nusually hopelessly
late in diagnosing that.
So, that's why often\nreferred to novelists.
This is a quote from the\ngreat, late José Saramago,
a great artist of the city.
I'm sure most of you know\nhis wonderful trilogy
of the urban condition\nthat we're in,
starting with The\nCity of the Blind,
and finishing, just a\nfew years before he died,
with a book that was translated\nto English as, Seeing,
but which, in Portuguese,\ntranslates better
as Essay on Lucidity.
And this is a comment\nthat he made in this book,
that democracy today has become\nthis sacrosanct principle that
we treat as a piece\nof a museum display,
but it cannot be questioned,\nnor be interrogated.
Let me just tell you the\nstory of the novel, Seeing.
It's the story of a city.
It's actually the\nsame city where,
just a few years earlier,\nmost all of the citizens
went blind, except for\nthis one woman, which
was, of course, a parable of\nthe situation that we are in.
In this third installment\nof his urban trilogy,
in the same city where\nsight had been restored,
that city was making itself\nup for the great festival
of democracy.
The subsequent next Sunday,\nthe citizens of the city
would vote for the\ngovernors of the city.
And as usual, the pundits\nand the journalists
all arguing and debating\nwhether the party of the left
will gain or lose 1%\nor 2%, or whether it
was the party of the right\nwho will gain 1% or 2%,
or whether it was the\nparty of the center
that will hold onto power.
Everyone was excited,\nand then the thunder
came, really bad thunder.
It was raining, bad weather.
And in the morning, when\nthose who put themselves up
as candidates to be the\ngovernors of the urban fate
of the citizens\nwho were anxiously
awaiting the verdict of\nthe democratic process,
got a bit anxious\nbecause no one showed up
to the polling stations.
But in the afternoon,\npeople started coming in,
and everyone sighed of relief.
And that evening, when\nthe votes were counted,
and those who put\nthemselves up would
know the verdict\nof the people, it
turned out that 50%\nof the population
had spoiled the ballot.
Panic.
"How can we govern the\ncity democratically
if we do not have the\nfull democratic support
of the population?
Something must have gone wrong."
And of course, as we\nnow know in Europe,
we do this systematically,\nif the people vote wrong,
we hold a new election.
The European Union\nis very good at that.
It had to do it several\ntimes in Denmark
and in France in the 1990s.
So, the governors decided\nto run the election again,
three weeks later.
And three weeks later it was\na beautiful day, a spring day,
and people went to the polling\nstations in big droves.
And at night, when the\nvotes were counted,
it turned out that 80%\nhad spoiled the ballot.
This time, the governor thought\nit was something going on.
"Surely, there must\nbe a conspiracy
against the sacrosanct\nprinciples of a democracy.
There must be some\nhidden terrorist cell
who is masterminding\nthis perversion
of the democratic process."
And, of course, they went\nsearching for the culprits.
But the usual tactics of\nintimidation, police action,
incarceration,\ntorture, to find out
those who were trying to\nundermine civilization
as we know it.
Couldn't find anyone.
So after three months\nof ruthless repression,
the governors\ndecided that it was
time to teach the citizens\nof the city as lesson.
They said, "We, the\ngovernors of the city,
are going to leave\nthe people alone.
We are going to abandon the\ncity," expecting, of course,
that in a minimum of time,\nwithout proper governing
of the city, that the city\nwould descend into anarchy,
and that the\ncitizens of the city
would beg the\ngovernors to come back
to restore peace and order\nin the disintegrating polis.
So, the governors left.
And what happened in the city?
Nothing.
The teachers kept on teaching.
The professors\nkept on professing.
The butchers kept on butchering.
The garbage men and women\nkept on cleaning the streets.
End of story.
So, I thought this story\nactually captures well what
I want to say.
And I'm in good company.
Here is Giorgio Agamben,\nItalian philosopher,
who, in 2006,\nobserved that, "There
is a shift from the model of the\npolis founded on a center, that
is, a public center or ogera,\nto a new metropolitan's
spatialization that\nis certainly invested
in a process of depoliticization
Now, this process of\ndepoliticization I, and others,
define and describe-- we'll\nsay a bit more about that
in a moment--
as a process of\npost politicization.
So I would argue that we're\nliving in post-political times,
in post political cities,\nincreasingly constructed
over the past 20 years or so,\nin the global north, primarily,
but with examples to be\nfound elsewhere, too.
For me, post-politicization\nis the gradual imposition
and generalization of the\ndiscourse and practice
of consensual\ntechno-managerial governance
in post-democratic\nforms of governance.
That's a whole mouthful.
We'll explain in a\nmoment more in detail
what I mean by the\nreduction of the political
to questions of\ntechno-managerial governing.
But then, 2011 came, and\n2011 was a magical year,
because it was the year\nmarked by the beginning
of proliferating sequence\nof what I, and many others,
have called urban insurgencies.
Here is my notes on the\ninsurgent architect.
It began in one of the\nusual sort of spaces,
the [INAUDIBLE], which was,\nof course quickly dismissed
and understood as the\nkind of stuff that happens
in these post-colonial spaces.
In a few weeks time, this\npractice of urban insurgency
spread like wildfire.
In Spain, hundreds,\nthousands of people
occupied for weeks,\nPuerta del Sol in Madrid.
Puerta de la Cataluña,\nin Barcelona,
the most well-known but\nwas happening elsewhere.
Syntagma Square in Athens\nwas occupied for months
by the outraged, as\nthey called them.
In the US, it became\nknown, experimented with,
worked with, under Occupy.
And of course it continued.
It was a strange sort of\noutburst of radical discontent
that expressed, however\ninchoate and incoherent it
was, a deep discontent with\nthe state of the situation,
and called in its performative\nstaging for something else.
But that something\nelse would operate
under the banner of this\nempty signifier of democracy
and equality.
Not all of those outbursts\nwere, nonetheless,
remotely democratizing\nin the sense
that you and I would\nlike to think of it.
This is my own city.
This is my street.
That's where I live.
In the summer of 2011, just like\nit happened in Paris earlier,
we had these violent anarchic\noutbursts of violence.
and it went on for three days.
Cameron, at the time, he\ncalled those protesters
outcasts that should\nbe swept from the city.
Those who are not entitled\nto be part of the city.
It's what in ancient Athens\nthey would call the [INAUDIBLE],
the rabble, those\nwho are not entitled
to be citizens of the city.
But then many,\nlike in Spain here,
there were these\npractices of what
I call insurgent democracy.
And this is in\nSpain, in Barcelona,
demanding "Democracia Real Ya!"
Real democracy now.
That's a bit of a scandalous\nstatement in Spain.
Spain, that had gone\nthrough a torturous history
in the 20th century, the\nlongest fascist dictatorship
in continental Europe, went\nthrough a fairly smooth
democratic transition\nin the 1980s.
No one would dare to\ncall Spain undemocratic.
And there, there were these\nassorted insurgent architects
asking for real democracy now.
What's going on what\nis the articulation,
or the difference, between these\nones with insurgent democracy
on the one hand, and instituted\nforms of existing politics?
And that kept on happening.
This was two years\nago for the opening
of the ECB, the European Central\nBank headquarters in Frankfurt,
where they organized a blockupy.
Let me point you to the\nimage on the right bottom,
and it says, "Let\'s\nchoose communism."
Now, in the US, that's\na bit of a banned term.
This is Frankfurt.
20 odd years or so after\nwe killed that monster,
and there are\nthose asking today,
"Let\'s choose communism."
That's quite an\noutrageous statement.
What is going on?
And this is Paris this\nyear, [INAUDIBLE],
also demanding\nreal democracy now.
Now, many of those\nuprisings have died out.
Many were just Bakhtinian,\ncarnivalesque outbursts
that staged the\nurban as a spectacle.
But in many ways, it definitely\nitched the powers that be.
As you know, the\nelites of the world
meet every year in\nthis little Swiss town
called Davos, where\nthey discuss, plan,
organize the\ngeography of the world
according to their\ndreams and desire.
It may not always\nwork like that,
but there we have\nthe master architects
of how their dreams can become\ngeographical in the world.
And of course they're acutely\naware of the barriers,
the obstacles that\nresist the making
geographical of their desires.
So, they publish every\nyear the World Risk Report.
It's a wonderful read\nactually, big tome, 600 pages,
usually, where they\ndocument the obstacles
to what they want to do.
In 2012 the title\nof the Risk Report
was called Seeds of Dystopia.
And I thought, what the\nhell are they talking about?
So, I had to read,\ndownload I think 600 pages,
and they referred precisely\nto the proliferation
of these outbursts\nof urban discontent.
I, in my naivety,\nthought of them
as sort of seeds of\npotential rebirth of utopia,
of a different kind than\nthe ones of the past.
But they called it\nSeeds of Dystopia,
just to indicate that it\ndid itch the powers that be.
So, this sets the\nscene, I think,
for exploring the paradox with\nwhich I introduced my talk.
So, the four things I\nwant to quickly go through
is to, first of all, do\nthe diagnosis of the times
within, and explore them\nin somewhat greater detail
what I mean by the\npost-political evacuation
of the political, something\nthat is very noticeable,
and that in other work I've\nexplored in empirical detail,
very noticeable in\nthe way in which
our cities are being governed.
To then say something\nabout the political.
You may have noticed that\nI've used, almost exclusively,
the word "the political"\nso far, and not "politics."
The kind of things\nthat we used to talk
about, urban politics,\nor national politics,
and choreographies of power,\nrepresentation, et cetera,
the kind of things I hear all\nthe time and I put on CNN,
they talk about politics.
I'm not particularly interest\nin politics these days,
it's utterly irrelevant\nand uninteresting.
I'm much more interested\nin the political.
So I want to say\nsomething theoretically
about that political diffidence,\nas Paul Ricoeur called it,
between politics\nand the political.
Because I think\nthat might help us
to make sense of this\nparadoxical situation
that we find in so\nmany other cities.
I think it will help\nus to make sense
of the insurgent democracy\nsteadily manifested
in these spaces of\nurban rebellion.
To conclude, to\nask the question,
great question again\nto ask whether we
can think, at the beginning\nof the 21st century,
whether we can think of The\nRe-Awakening of History,
as Alain Badiou calls it.
That is the question of whether\nit is possible to think,
because we in places\nlike this, we just think.
We don't do that much.
Well, I certainly don't.
I read, I write, and I talk.
So, the question is,\ncan we think today
the possibility of\na new urbanity where
the practices of emancipations\nof freedom, equality,
and solidarity can be practiced.
Or should we give\nup on that thought?
Is the only thing we can\ndo in the 21st century is
to mobilize the best of our\ntechno-managerial abilities,
and they are\nconsiderable, to massage
the situation that we're in?
That's the challenge.
But my point will be, if\nwe believe that there's
no other city\npossible, we should
stop talking about freedom,\nequality, solidarity,
and become good managers,\nand leave it at that.
So that's the\nintellectual challenge,
I think, I would like to leave\nyou with at the end of my talk.
So, let me say something\nfirst, about the process
of post-politicization.
I know it's a bit of an\nunfortunate turn because
of this funny prefix post,\nwhich of course suggests
a sort of temporal\ntransformation
that, once upon a time\nwe were political,
and now are not any longer, just\nlike post-modernity, sort of.
It's not like that.
That's not the\nmeaning of the term.
Maybe I should have\nused another one,
but other people have\nbeen using this term now,
and I did not want to\nconfuse matters even further.
Post-politicization is a\nparticular set of dispositives:
technical, managerial,\ninstitutional dispositive
that suspends, colonizes, or\n[INAUDIBLE] the political.
So, it's a set of\ndispositives that
lets the political\ndisappear, apparently.
So, to that, it suggests\nwhat I mean by the political,
it was already embedded\nin Michel Foucault's quote
at the beginning.
"For me, the political\nof others, the political
refers to the fact that\nthe people do not exist."
Well, in other words, that\nthe people are radically,
heterogeneously\nconstituted, that we
have radically\ndifferent desires,
dreams, feelings, sensibilities.
That there is no such thing\nas humanity, the people
as a political category.
In fact, that is what\nunder lies, of course,
the promise of the democratic.
The promise of the\ndemocratic is nothing else
that the recognition that\nthe people do not exist,
that the people are\nsplit, radically split.
So, post-politicization is a\nparticular tactic or strategy
to pretend that the split\nis not there, to suspend it.
The other tactics of doing\nso, Jacques Rancière,
French political philosopher,\nidentifies at least four
different tactics\nof depoliticization.
Let me give you a\nfew examples of that.
Archae-politics.
Archae-politics\nis the dispositive
that argues that the\ncommunity is inherently
cohesive and fine, but\nit's disintegration,
the heterogeneity that\nis expressed in community
is cast by an external intruder.
The extreme form\nof that, of course,
is the ultra-politics\nof fascism.
Yet Trump is a good\nexample of that.
We Americans are fine.
But, to that end, the cohesion\nof us, the American community,
is of course, the intruded\nthat comes from outside.
By doing so, this\npractice or rhetoric
covers up the\nradical heterogeneity
that cuts to the name, American,\nor Bostonian, or French.
Meta-politics it is a\ntactic that Marxists--
and I'm a bit of a Marxist,\nalways was, always will be--
it was a tactics that Marxist\npolitics in the 20th century
often mobilized erroneously.
So, I think the sort of standard\nargument where they say,
"It\'s not politics, you stupid."
Where the dynamics of\nchange and the possibilities
of a different world, or the\ndisintegrating world, resides,
it's in the economy.
It is the class relationships.
You want to change the world,\nchange the class system.
There is nothing\nelse than a tactic
of displacing the terrain of the\npolitical onto something else,
in this case, class struggle.
Also a form of suspending\nthe democratic.
So, post-politicization\nis one particular tactic,
and it's characterized\nby a number of things.
Let me quickly go through\nthe key characteristics
of post-politicization,\nthe way it
has become\nincreasingly entrenched
in our cities over the\npast 20 years or so.
First of all,\npost-politics is sustained
by the continuous invocation of\na permanent state of emergency,
as Giorgio Agamben\nwould call it.
The permanent invocation\nof a state of crisis,
and that articulates usually\naround four key axis:
the economy, migration,\nsecurity, and the environment.
Dealing with a state of\nemergency, take immigration,
dealing with a\nstate of emergency
requires urgent and\nimmediate action,
that of course, of necessity,\nsuspends the slow, painful,
and difficulty, Kapleau says,\nof democratic negotiation
and inter-mediation.
Secondly, situations\ncharacterized
by what Badiou already called in\nthe late 90s, the economization
of politics.
That means that only those\npolitical choices are possible,
that fit onto a Microsoft\nExcel spreadsheet.
In other words, only\nthose political choices
are deemed reasonable that\nfit within a market logic.
Let me give you an\nexample of that.
I come from Flandres.
I grew up in a very small\nvillage in the 1960s.
I am now a professor\nat the University
of Manchester there, and giving\na talk at GSD at Harvard.
I never paid a penny\nfor my education.
I never paid a penny\nfor my education.
It was free and self-understood.
Unquestioned where I\ncome from in Belgium.
I'm still grateful to the\nextraordinary fights that
were fought in order\nto make possible
that mechanism of\ndistribution over there,
so that I was the first\none out of my family
to go to university,\ncould end up
as an emancipated\nspeaker standing here.
It's quite a trajectory\nof emancipation,
would not have happened,\nI think, without that.
If I were to say\ntoday, not in the US,
because that would\nbe unheard of,
but in the UK, that education\nshould be free for all who
can and wish to\nparticipate in education,
they consider me to\nbe a dinosaur who
has forgotten that the 20th\ncentury is forever over.
That's what is meant by the\neconomization of politics.
Because in urban governance,\nyou see this repeated time
after time again.
And that is strangely\nenough, paralleled
by the depoliticized of the\neconomic slash ecological.
I understand the\necological, of course,
as the process through which we\ntransform nature, and allocate
the fruits of that nature.
So, the economy not\na very good term,
it's basically the ecology,\nthe ecological issue,
that cannot be politicized.
In other words, there\nare no public choices
possible about the way we\naccess nature, transform nature,
and allocate the\nproduct of that, both
the goods and the bads of that.
Or, it can only be\ndiscussed to the extent
that we reduce it to a\ntechno-managerial issue.
And all that is sustained\nby expert management,
by us, who keep on reproducing\nthese kind of knowledges
as unquestionable.
Why is that done?
What makes it so\nattractive, so seductive?
Why do so many of us desire this\ndepoliticized configuration?
I think Roberto Esposito,\nanother Italian philosopher,
comes up with\npartial answer when
he says that what we have today\nis a further deepening of what
Michel Foucault\nalready identified
as political governance,\nto what Esposito
calls an immunological\nbiopolitical governance.
And immunological\nhas to be understood
as the process of suspension,\nof the obligation to participate
in the community.
That is, right to have\nasylum from being piled off
the polity.
Of course, neoliberal\nindividualism precisely,
the example embedding of that.
But if I take a sort of\nmore mundane situation,
is the environment,\nthe ecological issue.
We know is threatening\nus, don't we?
And we try to mobilize all\nsort of techno-managerial
dispositives in order\nto produce asylums,
so that we're shielded\noff from the ecological,
or the socio-ecological\nexcesses that threaten us.
That immunological\nbiopolitical governance
is, of course, a process of\nnot just making life, deciding
who is entitled to live.
That's my type.
I live in the gentrified,\necotopian bubble of Amsterdam.
It's wonderful.
It's sustainable.
And it's damn smart, too.
But that comes extraordinary\nexpense at the same time.
We produce through that those\nwho are not immunologized,
those who are exiled.
The bottom of the\nMediterranean Sea
is filled with\nthose bodies, which
are the flip-side, of course, of\nthe immunological biopolitical
governance that is\nso dominant today.
It\'s not just a process\nof, "make live."
But it\'s process of\n"make live and make
die," as two sides\nof the same coin.
And all that is\ninstitutionally sustained
by, what I and\nothers have called,
autocratic forms of\npost-democratic governance
beyond the state.
That is, that the registers\nof instituted, quote
unquote, "democratic\ngovernance,"
or increasingly\npopulated by what
Ulrich Beck called unauthorized\nactors and unauthorized agents.
It's what, in the\nplanning literature,
is usually called public-private\npartnerships, urban governance
arrangements, in which not\nonly the state participates,
but all sorts of private\nagents and actors participate,
some private companies\nto our beloved NGOs.
But these are\nunauthorized actors.
They have absolutely no\ndemocratic or other legitimacy.
Nonetheless, they\nincreasingly decide
the techno-managerial structure\nof everyday governing.
You can feel it\nin your body when
you walk around in a city like\nAthens, or Thessaloniki today.
You all know, of course,\nthe chaos and the suffering
that has been inflicted\non the great people,
and which is manifestly\nsensible in places
like Athens and Thessaloniki,\nfor all those who visit it,
they know.
You feel it, you see it,\nyou touch it, you smell it.
All, of course,\nthe direct outcome
of post-political\ntechno-managerial governance.
Where there was no\nchoice possible.
Indeed, the conditions\nof crisis and of fear,
which are continuously nurtured,\nthe elites keep on telling us,
can be nonetheless\nmanaged, for some,
through demobilization or\ntechno-managerial dispositives.
And that is further\nsustained by what
a colleague of\nmine in Manchester
called, "the tyranny\nof participation."
In planning, you\nfind that whole time
that democratization\nis understood
as the participation of citizens\nin decision making processes
We're telling our beloved\npoor in our cities,
in the global north\nand global south,
that it can and\nshould participate
in the decision\nmaking, the stuff that
is important to them.
That's what we tell them.
"Do you participate,\nhere in Boston,
in the management of your\nsewage system, transport system,
educational system, cultural\npolicies, et cetera?"
Perhaps some of you do.
I don't.
I don't have the time to do so.
I don't want to do\nthat because it's
techno-managerial exercise, and\nhas absolutely nothing to do
with the democratic.
The democratic has\nto do with the fact
that if my water doesn't flow\nin Manchester, pick up the phone
and say, "Hey, 15 minutes and\nI want it to be restored."
That's democracy.
So, in this kind\nof configuration,
the most important\nelement of that
is that the cultural\ncondition that supports that
is one that invites a dispute.
Dispute is not censored.
Dispute is, in fact,\nactively invited.
Now, I am the master disputer.
I come up with all these\ncritical theories and analyses,
and my university loves me.
They pay me handsomely for it.
And I get invited\nto elite places
to do this critical dispute of\nthe situation that we are in.
And people love it.
It's invited.
This is actually the\nsupport structured off.
Of
However, while\ndispute is invited,
while we are being invited\nto be whoever we want to be,
in gender, cloth,\nethnic, religious terms,
some things are\ntabooed, or censored.
That is the dispute,\nthe radical censors,
as Jacques Rancière\nwould call it,
over different forms of life,\ndifferent forms of urbanity,
that articulate around radically\ndifferent political choices.
If I were to say,\n"I want to fight
for a city of the common," that\nwould be just about acceptable,
it I dress it up nicely.
If I were to say, "I\nwant a communist city,"
I may, next time, not get\na visa to get into the US,
given what I read this\nmorning in the newspaper.
So, Fukuyama-- for those\nold enough may just remember
Fukuyama's idiotic book in\n1992, The End of History,
where he got Hegel completely\nwrong, I thought at the time,
in my youthful arrogance--
now, 30-odd years\nlater, Fukuyama
may not have been a\ngreat [INAUDIBLE],
but his announcement\nof the end of history
sounds chillingly true today.
Now this strange\nsense of consensus
among the liberal elites that\nhave governed over the past 20
years, that sustain this ideal\nof an unfractured possibility,
of unfractured society, is of\ncourse ruthlessly disturbed
by the fragmenting\nforces that animate
so much of our urban life.
So, the fragmenting forces,\nthe flip side, so to speak,
of this attempt to\neradicate the political
from the spaces of\nsocial and policy
encountered all the fragmenting\nforces that operate that,
on the one hand, the\nlure of identity,
what [INAUDIBLE]\nand others called,
"ethnic evil," which, of\ncourse, is animating so much
of our urban everyday lives.
This is a Golden Dawn\nin Athens, and you all
know what that\nsymbol stands for.
That is the eruptions of urban,\nviolent, dissensual outbursts,
whether you're talking about\nterrorist attacks, too just
anarchic outbursts of violence.
These anarchic\noutbursts of violence,
such as those in Manchester,\nand London, or Paris, Stockholm,
and many other places--
and there will be more, I\npromise you there will be more.
Read my lips, you don't\nhave to be a genius
to know that that will\ncontinue to happen.
However, the elites\nkeep on insisting
that those who engage in that\nare archae scum, like those
who vote for Trump, right?
And of course, it is\nthat identification
that embodies that\ndisavowal of the political.
But on the other\nhand, the other type
of fragmenting\nvoices, forces, are
those who want to fight for\nthe new universalization.
That is, those who's return\nto, what Badiou calls
the "Passion of the Real."
The real of the common under\nthe banner of equality.
Those who, in their\nurban insurgent acting,
prefigured tentatively,\nhesitantly,
and with many uncertainties,\nand without much help
from our types, who\ntry to prefigure,
democratically, the\npractice of being
in common, and who are\nexperimenting, in many places,
a citizen of the world with new\nways of organizing common life
democratically.
And occasionally,\nnot very often--
when I gave this talk five\nyears ago, I couldn't say this--
but today, we can see that\nsome of these outbursts
are politically performative.
As one, I guess, now\nknows, Ada Colau,
the new mayor of Barcelona,\nwho was just a few years ago
put in jail because he was\nprotesting with the Indignados.
And, of course, in\nGreece, he resides
in power, the first\nradical left government
in the postwar period\nin Greece, though
not in part of these urban\ninsurrectional movements.
So, in order to\nmake sense of that,
I think it's important to make\na distinction between politics
on the one hand, and the\npolitical on the other,
which are two worlds that\ncoexist simultaneously
in the urban.
In French, we have such\nbeautifully gendered language.
It's called le politic\nand la politic.
It's very difficult to\ntranslate into English,
but it's commonly\ntranslated as politics,
which is the antek, that is, the\nempirically verifiable tactics
and strategies of\nurban governance,
with its rituals, its\npractices, its actors, and ages.
It's the kind of stuff that you\nand I are usually very good at.
Now, give me a city\nfor a week, and I'll
do a the analysis of its\nurban governance systems.
I could do that blindfoldedly.
It is the arctic\nlevel of politics.
Now, we seem to have\nreduced our thought
about and our considerations\nof urban governing
to these practices\nof governing, as
if that colonizes the whole\nof the political field.
The political, in\ncontrast, is ontological,
as some of my\ninterlocutors would argue.
The political is the name, the\nword that stands for the fact
that we disagree.
It stands for the radical\nheterogeneity that
cuts through the\nsocial, and it is
that that manifests\nitself, that becomes
symptomatically present\nurban those outbursts,
that's when you see it.
So, theoretically\nthere are a number
of theoretical genealogies.
It was Paul Ricœur, who\nalready in the 60s made that
distinction, but now there are\na whole series of philosophical
and political arguments\nthat circulate around this
post-foundational thought.
Post-foundational thought\nthat is that the political is
nothing else than\nradical heterogeneity
that cuts through the social,\nand that manifests itself,
occasionally in antagonism.
What happens if we add\ndemocratic to the political?
And it's something that\nwe urban theorists,
or urban intellectuals, very\nrarely think about again.
How many books are there\nabout the democratic,
the urban democratic\nof the past 20 years
compared to books on urban\npolitics, and other governance,
so poor I can't\nread them anymore.
So, let me remind you of a few\nthings of what the democratic
is, symptomatically.
What the democratic invention,\ncontingent as it was,
insisted on.
It insists, of course, on\nthe empty place of power,
as Claude Leford would have it,\nthat anyone and everyone can,
at least temporarily,\nclaim the place of power.
But most importantly,\nit presumes equality.
Equality, understood as the\naxiomatic capacity of each
and all to act politically.
Contrast that with the\nnotion of social equality,
we all know we are\nsocially unequal.
Right?
Marxists, feminists,\npost-colonialists
have explored, in great detail,\nthe various social inequalities
that animate urban life\nand progressive politics,
etching itself on\nthese inequalities set.
We have to remedy that.
That is a perversion\nof the democratic.
The foundation of the\ndemocratic is the presumption
of equality of each and all\nwho are speaking beings,
irrespective of the\nsocial place we take
in the geographical edifice.
And the democratic is nothing\nelse than the assertion of what
Balibar would\ncall, "Égaliberté."
Freedom and equality\nfused together.
And it is precisely this, what I\nwould argue, is being suspended
and disavowed in our\npost-democratic cities.
And it's precisely\nin such a condition,
that the democratic, as\nan insurgent practice,
manifests itself occasionally.
So, here we begin to have I\nwould argue a sense of what
these insurgent architects\nare all about in their first
forming act of\ninsurgent democracy,
because they are acutely\naware, of course, that's
just the [? fundaments. ?]\nSo, the political,
then, I understand\nas a retroactively
revealed moment of eruption.
An event, in Badiou's term.
One that is always placed and\ngeographical and decidedly
urban that opens up a procedure\nthat disrupts any given
social spatial order.
It's one that addresses a wrong,\nin the name of a contingent
and utterly axiomatic\npresumption of equality
of each and every one.
This wrong is a\ncondition in which
the presumption of equality is\nperverted to the institution
of an oligarchic police.
We live today in an\noligarchic police order.
The political advises,\nthen, in the act
of performatively staging\nequality, a procedure that
simultaneously stages\nequality, so it's not
us, the master philosophers, who\ndecide what equality is, but is
in the performative acting,\nin the bodily performance
in space, that the very content\nand substance of equality
is being defined.
And it demonstrates\nthe possibility
for the inauguration of\na new instituted order.
This sounds very theoretical.
Let me give you\na simple example.
Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955,\nAfrican-American woman called
Rosa Parks--
I'm sure you all\nremember her, she
died two or three years ago--
she put African-American bum\non the wrong seat of the bus.
We all know the story?
Many had done this before.
What happened when you\ndo something like that,
as happened with her?
You get beaten up, thrown off\nthe bus, put in jail, or worse.
Right?
Why do we remember Rosa Parks\nin her minimal displacement,
but which, nonetheless,\nconstituted,
retroactively, a political\nevent in which she demonstrated
alone, the initial Italian\norder of racialists,
racialized configuration,\nand demonstrated equality
at the same time.
It is in the subsequent\nuniversalizing a procedure
whereby other the Americans\nand non-Americans,
African-Americans and\nnon-African-Americans, women
and men, old and young,\nsaid, "I am Rosa Parks too."
And we call it today the\ncivil rights movement.
Was it a democratizing movement?
Yes, it was.
Is it perfect?
No, not by a long way.
So, we may begin--
I'm going to conclude now-- we\nmay begin to get a sense here
of what insurgent urban\ndemocratic acting is all about.
For me, the sort\nof performativities
where the democratic\nis kept alive
against all these\nsuturing attempts
of the institutional\norder to suspend this.
That is, that insurgent\ndemocracy operates,
as Miguel Abensour\nargues, against the state,
or at a distance from the state.
It is, as Badiou would call,\na politics of subtraction.
It falls in public space outside\nof the institute of spaces,
of governance.
The political is no foundational\nplace, location, or subject,
it's a process of\ncommon subjectivation.
My Marxist friends hate this\nstatement, because of course,
Marxists would say,\n"It\'s class, you stupid."
Well, it ain't.
If I look at the composition\nof this insurgent, urbanist,
preferly heterogeneous,\nthe men and women
of all sort of ethnic,\nreligious composition, that
cut through the\nindentitarian embodiments,
in the name of a universalizing\nequality, which they consider
to be the very condition of\npossibility, to have that
embody differences.
But you have to want it.
It's a desire that\nyou have to want.
So, that's another thing my\nMarxist friends don't like.
It's a process of\nbecoming subject
that is the will to take sides.
Insurgent democratic\nacting is always specific.
It's always concrete.
It's always particular.
Remember Istanbul, 2013,\nGezi Park was about a few
[INAUDIBLE] trees and\na badly designed mosque
that assembled several\nhundred thousand people who,
after a few weeks, were\ndemanding a transformation
of the Constitution.
I would argue we can not\nunderstand what is happening
